          "Here's to the crazy ones.
          <br />
          The misfits.
          <br />
          The rebels.
          <br />
          The troublemakers.
          <br />
          The round pegs in the square holes.
          <br />
          The ones who see things differently.
          <br />
          They're not fond of rules.
          <br />
          And they have no respect for the status quo.
          <br />
          You could quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.
          <br />
          About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.
          <br />
          Because their change things.
          <br />
          <br />
          And while some may see them as the crazy ones...
          <br />
          We see qenius.
          <br />
          Because the people who are crazy enought to think they can change the world...
          ...are the ones who do."
